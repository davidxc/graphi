I haven't written unit tests for Graphi yet.

Checking correctness has been done by hand, by comparing the directed graph and table output
to the output from Python's pstats. I've done this for several programs, and the numbers have 
matched up.

I'll probably add unit tests in the future. If you have a specific request for a test, or find 
an error, email me at davidwong.xc@gmail.com. 

I've included a couple of Python's cProfile's output files here. The files are output1 and output2.
